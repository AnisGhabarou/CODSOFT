# Codsoft C++ Programming Internship Showcase

Welcome to the repository showcasing my journey through the Codsoft C++ Programming Internship! Throughout this internship, I had the privilege of working on four diverse and engaging projects that explored various facets of C++ programming.

## Overview

This internship has proven to be an invaluable learning experience for me, providing a platform to enhance my skills and gain practical insights into the world of C++ development. I am thrilled to present the results of my hard work and the knowledge I've gained during this enriching journey.

## Projects

1. [Project 1 NUMBER GUESSING GAME]
   [ Create a program that:
     - Generates a random number.
     - Asks the user to guess it.
     - Provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.]

2. [Project 2  SIMPLE CALCULATOR]
   [ Develop a calculator program that:
     - Performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
     - Allow the user to input two numbers and choose an operation to perform.]

3. [Project 3  TIC-TAC-TOE GAME]
   [ Build a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that:
     - Allows two players to play against each other.
     - Game Board: Create a 3x3 grid as the game board.
     - Players: Assign "X" and "O" to two players.
     - Display Board: Show the current state of the board.
     - Player Input: Prompt the current player to enter their move.
     - Update Board: Update the game board with the player's move.
     - Check for Win: Check if the current player has won.
     - Check for Draw: Determine if the game is a draw.
     - Switch Players: Alternate turns between "X" and "O" players.
     - Display Result: Show the result of the game (win, draw, or ongoing).
     - Play Again: Ask if the players want to play another game.
